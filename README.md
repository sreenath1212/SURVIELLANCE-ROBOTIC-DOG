# SURVIELLANCE-ROBOTIC-DOG
Surveillance Robotic Dog: Autonomous robot for security &amp; monitoring. Detects and tracks suspicious activity using Ultrasonic, IR, PIR, &amp; Compass sensors. Built with PIC16F877A. Ideal for border patrol, industrial, and event security. Enhances safety.


## Project Overview

The **Surveillance Robotic Dog** is an innovative robotics project designed to autonomously patrol and monitor various environments, replicating the functions of a security dog. It integrates intelligent systems for real-time decision-making and threat assessment, capable of detecting and tracking suspicious activity while navigating diverse terrains.

## Key Features

* **Autonomous Navigation:** The robot is engineered to move independently and intelligently across different surfaces to perform continuous surveillance.
* **Advanced Sensing Capabilities:** Equipped with:
    * **Ultrasonic Sensor:** For distance measurement and obstacle detection.
    * **IR Sensor:** For detecting objects and motion.
    * **PIR (Passive Infrared) Sensor:** For human or animal presence detection.
    * **Compass Sensor:** For directional awareness and navigation.
* **Integrated Alert System:** Features a barking sound module with an amplifier and speaker to generate alerts upon detecting suspicious activity.
* **Embedded Control:** The core logic and control are managed by the robust PIC16F877A microcontroller.
* **Real-time Feedback:** An LCD display provides immediate operational status and data readouts.

## Technologies Used

* **Microcontroller:** PIC16F877A
* **Sensors:** Ultrasonic, Infrared (IR), Passive Infrared (PIR), Compass
* **Actuators:** DC Motors, Stepper Motors
* **Output Devices:** LCD Module, Barking Sound IC, Amplifier Module, Speaker
* **Development Tools:**
    * **Proteus 8:** Used for circuit simulation, schematic capture, and PCB design.
    * **MPLAB IDE:** Integrated Development Environment for PIC microcontrollers.
    * **XC8 Compiler:** C compiler for PIC microcontrollers.

## Potential Applications

The Surveillance Robotic Dog is a versatile solution suitable for a wide range of security and monitoring scenarios, including:

* Border Patrol
* Industrial Facilities Security
* Event Security
* Military Defense
